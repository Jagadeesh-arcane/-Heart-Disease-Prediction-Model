# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction with Logistic Regression & Random Forest

This project predicts the presence of heart disease using the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from UCI. The initial model was built using **Logistic Regression**, and further improved using **Random Forest** with **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Heart Disease UCI Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci)
- **Features**: 14
- **Target**: Presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease

## 🚀 Workflow

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature scaling
4. Model training (Logistic Regression)
5. Model tuning with Random Forest and GridSearchCV
6. Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

## 🧠 ML Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

## 📝 Results

- **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: ~73%
- **Random Forest (Tuned) Accuracy**: ~78%
- Improved recall and F1-score using ensemble methods
